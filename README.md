Experimental Aircraft Avionics

This repository is the public code and design store for the Kotuku Aerospace http://www.kotuku.aero contributed avionics project.

The goal of DIY-EFIS is to provide a reference implementation of an open-source avionics stack.

The display technology is based on a [Raspberry-PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and a 3D printed case and a power supply with a PIC processor implementing the CanFly protocol

The simplest way to try the code is to build on Microsoft Windows.  This is not a supported platform for the actual device but will allow you to easily test the devices.

* If you don't have Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 download a free copy from [www.visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/cplusplus/)
* I use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download) to do the checkout of the DIY-EFIS repository.
* Open the project file /win32_tools/diy-efis.sln
* Set the default project to pfd.

We are working actively on the yehudi branch.

** Raspberry PI **
Portable C code that implements a full graphical display for avionics that can run on very low power devices.  The development environment is Eclipse on Linux or Visual Studio on Windows

diy-efis is managed by Kotuku Aerospace and forms the basis of all hardware designs provided by them.  The Kotuku designs are all 32bit embedded solutions and embed the latest code.
